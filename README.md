# Identifying Cats or Dogs Using a Simple CNN

This project demonstrates how to build a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify images as either a cat or a dog. The project uses Python and TensorFlow to preprocess data, train the CNN model, and evaluate its performance.

## Features

- Data preprocessing for training and testing datasets.
- Implementation of a CNN architecture using TensorFlow and Keras.
- Training the model to differentiate between cats and dogs.
- Evaluation of model accuracy and performance.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/darshal-2000/identifying-cat-or-dog-using-simple-cnn.git
   ```
2. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow
   ```

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset. The dataset should include images of cats and dogs, divided into training and testing folders.
2. Run the `CNN for Image Classification.ipynb` notebook:
   - Open the notebook in Jupyter or a similar environment.
   - Follow the instructions in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and test it.
3. Observe the model's predictions and performance metrics.

## Project Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Prepare the training and testing datasets by resizing and normalizing images.
   - Apply data augmentation techniques to improve model robustness.

2. **Building the CNN**:
   - Use TensorFlow and Keras to create a CNN model with layers such as convolutional, pooling, and dense layers.

3. **Training and Evaluation**:
   - Train the model on the dataset and validate it using testing data.
   - Evaluate the model's accuracy and make predictions.

## Results

The CNN successfully classifies images as either a cat or a dog based on the training data. Detailed results and performance metrics can be found in the notebook.
